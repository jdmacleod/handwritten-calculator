# Handwritten Calculator Demo

Welcome to the Handwritten Calculator Demo! This project consists of a web app frontend built with Flask and Javascript and a backend service using Python Flask and TensorFlow. Both components can be run locally.

## Prerequisites

[Python 3.12](https://www.python.org/) and [Python Virtual Environments](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#create-and-use-virtual-environments) were used when testing this demo.

## Quick Start

To get both the frontend and backend running, follow the Quick Start in the README for each component:

- **Frontend:** [README](./frontend/README.md)
- **Backend:** [README](./backend/README.md)

You can access them at:

- **Frontend:** [http://localhost:5001](http://localhost:5001)
- **Backend:** [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

### Running the Backend Locally

Options for the `MODEL_TYPE` value in [development.env](./backend/development.env) are "cnn" and "mlp" (default).
